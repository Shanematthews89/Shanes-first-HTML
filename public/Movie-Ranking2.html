<h1>Shane's Top Three Movies</h1>
<h2>My favourite movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Friday Night Lights</h3><br />
<P>This movie always seems to inspire me. I find it so interesting as it is based on a true story how serious Americans take highschool football. In one scene they mention that the coach gets paid more than the principal which I beleive potentially touches on a real issue within the school system. There is action, drama some funny aspects aswell however my favourite thing about this movie is the soundtrack. There are no words in the soundtrack songs just beautiful instrumentals these instrumentals someone can fire me up and motivate me when I need it.</p>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<P>Great movie, gets deep with a giant twist at the end and who could forgot the famous line "you do not talk about fight club"</P>
<h3>Training Day</h3>
<p>Interesting movie has me hooked from start to finish, crazy how the movie is based on one day with all the events that happen</P>
